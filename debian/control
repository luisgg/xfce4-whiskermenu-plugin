Description: Alternate Xfce menu
 An alternate application launcher for Xfce. When you open it you
 are shown a list of applications you have marked as favorites. You
 can browse through all of your installed applications by clicking
 on the category buttons on the side. Top level catagories make
 browsing fast, and simple to switch between. Additionally, Whisker
 Menu keeps a list of the last ten applications that you’ve launched
 from it.
